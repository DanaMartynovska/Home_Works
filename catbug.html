Catbug
</h1>
<h2>
    Personality
</h2>
<p>
    Catbug acts like a 10 year old though in the comics it is implied that he is, in fact, several decades old, and has a very sweet and childlike personality.
</p>
<p>
    Catbug's personality also makes him seem simpler and more carefree, like in the episode "Gas-Powered Stick," where he was seen talking to a spider, and in the episode "Catbug" when Danny yelled to drop the sugar peas, and he cheerfully did so. This simple attitude is also shown when he suggests throwing a blanket over the tainted gifts to stop them from growing in the same episode. Like most children, he is very kind and eager to make friends and interact with people, but can still fail to grasp the consequences of his actions as seen by his beheading of Jelly Kid, though this may be in part due to his nature as an animal.
</p>
<p>
    On that subject, Catbug has shown to have a darker side, proven by the fact that he murdered Jelly Kid for no foreseeable reason and then showed no remorse. Beth described such a thing as part of his badass animal instincts. In the Catbug mini-episode he is shown to keep a dead rat as a plaything in much the same way a cat would play with its prey.  During the episode "Hamster Priest" an alternate Catbug is shown to be the tyrannical despot of another dimension.
